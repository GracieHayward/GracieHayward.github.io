        <b>Identity, Values and Strengths</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        During my studies (BFA in Fashion and Sustainability) I often considered my ethics and values, as the fashion 
        industry is so rife with exploitation of both people and resources. This forced me to confront my place and 
        the implications of my contributions to the sector. 
        <br>
        As part of my end of year collection, I chose to employ different sustainable practices to reflect my 
        personal values and to support ideas presented in my Fashion Theory paper. Mainly my focus was to make 
        my garments bio-degradable by constructing them with exclusively natural fibres, not using any notions 
        (metal buttons, zips etc.) and natural-dyeing, using plant extracts.
        I already had all of the fabrics and plant extracts needed for my collection when we went into a lockdown 
        but because of covid restrictions sourcing the silk thread that I'd intended on using became increasingly 
        difficult. Most threads available are a polyester/blend meaning they're non-biodegradable and while this 
        is a minor detail, I felt that using the polyester thread immediately available to me undermined the integrity
        of my work.
        <br>
        Because of time-restraints it was a decision between guaranteeing I finish my collection and get my degree, 
        or wait to source silk thread and risk breaching my deadline. I chose to continue with polyester 
        thread in order to finish my collection because ultimately that was more important to me but I was really 
        disappointed that I ended up producing something that contradicted the values that informed my planning and research. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Compassion, connection and integrity are three of my core values. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A strength that aids my learning is my creativity. For a long time I viewed my creativity as something that was 
        purely practical, based on my love of drawing and making things with my hands. I grew to realise that creativity is
        expressed in many ways, at times beneficial and others limiting. It drives me to find solutions, allowing me to
        approach challenges from a nuanced perspective but it also manifests in less productive ways such as daydreaming. I often 
        find my mind wandering, which leads to one of my biggest limitations in terms of my learning and development -
        my struggle to pay attention or maintain focus. This plays into my tendency to procrastinate, sometimes I'll avoid 
        tasks in response to the frustration I feel about how difficult it can be for me to buckle down and get things done. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An example of when I experienced resistance/tension when trying to work productively with others occurred during my 
        first year at University. We had been assigned into small groups of around 5 students and our assignment was to make
        a short film. Because we were on a short time-frame, the work involved a lot of out-of-school hours. It became clear very
        quickly that people had differing amounts of investment into the project but the work involved the participation of all 
        students. The student who had been assigned the leader of the project, put a lot of pressure on themselves to achieve 
        high results but was struggling with the weight of responsibility. 
        <br>
        The challenge for me was trying to make sure everyone was happy, so that we could work together effectively. 
        I consoled the team leader, encouraging breaks in order to calm themselves. From there we were able to come up with 
        a plan and designated roles to each member of the team, so that responsibilities were more fairly distributed. 
        <br>
        In the future I would encourage better planning and distribution of responsibilities from the beginning of a project. 
        I think listing goals and expectations is really helpful in group-work situations, as it allows you to create a shared 
        vision. This isn't possible without open discussion and inclusivity.
