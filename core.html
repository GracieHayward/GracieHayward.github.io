        <b>Identity, Values and Strengths</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        During my studies (BFA in Fashion and Sustainability) I often considered my ethics and values, as the fashion 
        industry is so rife with exploitation of both people and resources. This forced me to confront my place and 
        the implications of my contributions to the sector. 
        <br>
        As part of my end of year collection, I chose to employ different sustainable practices to reflect my 
        personal values and to support ideas presented in my Fashion Theory paper. Mainly my focus was to make 
        my garments bio-degradable by constructing them with exclusively natural fibres, not using any notions 
        (metal buttons, zips etc.) and natural-dyeing, using plant extracts.
        I already had all of the fabrics and plant extracts needed for my collection when we went into a lockdown 
        but because of covid restrictions sourcing the silk thread that I'd intended on using became increasingly 
        difficult. Most threads available are a polyester/blend meaning they're non-biodegradable and while this 
        is a minor detail, I felt that using the polyester thread immediately available to me undermined the integrity
        of my work.
        <br>
        Because of time-restraints it was a decision between guaranteeing I finish my collection and get my degree, 
        or wait to source silk thread and risk breaching my deadline. I chose to continue with polyester 
        thread in order to finish my collection because ultimately that was more important to me but I was really 
        disappointed that I ended up producing something that contradicted the values that informed my planning and research. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Compassion, connection and integrity are three of my core values. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A strength that aids my learning is my creativity. For a long time I viewed my creativity as something that was 
        purely practical, based on my love of drawing and making things with my hands. I grew to realise that creativity is
        expressed in many ways, at times beneficial and others limiting. It drives me to find solutions, allowing me to
        approach challenges from a nuanced perspective but it also manifests in less productive ways such as daydreaming. I often 
        find my mind wandering, which leads to one of my biggest limitations in terms of my learning and development -
        my struggle to pay attention or maintain focus. This plays into my tendency to procrastinate, sometimes I'll avoid 
        tasks in response to the frustration I feel about how difficult it can be for me to buckle down and get things done. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An example of when I experienced resistance/tension when trying to work productively with others occurred during my 
        first year at University. We had been assigned into small groups of around 5 students and our assignment was to make
        a short film. Because we were on a short time-frame, the work involved a lot of out-of-school hours. It became clear very
        quickly that people had differing amounts of investment into the project but the work involved the participation of all 
        students. The student who had been assigned the leader of the project, put a lot of pressure on themselves to achieve 
        high results but was struggling with the weight of responsibility. 
        <br>
        The challenge for me was trying to make sure everyone was happy, so that we could work together effectively. 
        I consoled the team leader, encouraging breaks in order to calm themselves. From there we were able to come up with 
        a plan and designated roles to each member of the team, so that responsibilities were more fairly distributed. 
        <br>
        In the future I would encourage better planning and distribution of responsibilities from the beginning of a project. 
        I think listing goals and expectations is really helpful in group-work situations, as it allows you to create a shared 
        vision. This isn't possible without open discussion and inclusivity.

      <p>
        <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em>
        <br>
        I want to go overseas in the next year, so being able to work remotely as a web developer is a priority for me. 
        Freelancing or being employed by a company are both options I would consider. Being an employee offers more financial
        stability, which is appealing but freelancing allows for more flexibility. Whatever route I decide to go, I would
        still like to pursue a creative fashion practice, so having time availability/balance is also really important to me.
      
      </p>
      <p class="new-text">
       I have the same intentions as I did at the beginning of foundations. Ultimately I want to do something that challenges and excites me, while being able to financially support myself and any future family I may have. 
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </em> 
        <br>
        I'd really like to become more comfortable speaking in groups. I have a bad fear of public speaking, that I need to 
        overcome. It's really limiting in many aspects of life, such as social and learning environments. 
      </p>
      <p class="new-text">
        To be able to communicate confidently with individuals and groups. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</em>
        <br>
        The best way for me to optimise productivity and manage my time is to have a consistent and well-balanced 
        routine. 
        <br>
        It's important to me that I don't disappoint myself or others by setting out unrealistic expectations of what I am able 
        to achieve within certain time-frames - which is why communication and transparency is so important when working with others. 
      </p>
      <p class="new-text">
        Dedication, making Dev Academy my priority - while staying mindful of my health, both mental and physical. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</em>
        <br>
        How and where I ask for help is dependent on what I'm needing help with and my comfort levels with the individual or people 
        that I'm requesting help from. It's useful to know that I have a network of support people to reach out-to, when in need!
        For example, today I reached out to a friend who has experience with HTML and CSS when I was clouded by confusion, we worked 
        through my problems together and things quickly became a lot clearer. 
      </p>
      <p class="new-text">
        Reach out when I'm stuck. I have a fear of being trampled by the workload and pace, so I trust that I'll reach out when in need to avoid being stagnant in overwhelm. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </em>
        <br>
        My expectations are that the team will be able to facilitate my learning by encouraging critical thinking, problem solving
        and guiding me when necessary to overcome obstacles. 
      </p>
      <p class="new-text">
        That my facilitators will guide my learning journey with patience and encouragement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</em>
        <br>
        I'm in a very privileged position being able to dedicate this time to Dev Academy without having big commitments that
        others may have needed to sacrifice - or that would've prevented them from being able to do the course. 
      </p>

      <p id="emotional-intelligence" style="font-size:12.5pt;"><b>Emotional Intelligence</b></p>
      <p>
        <em> What is emotional intelligence? </em>
        <br>
        Emotional intelligence refer to a person's ability to identify, perceive, control and express emotions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "The ability to monitor one's own and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions.”
        <br>
        - Salovey and Mayer 1990
    
        <br>
        <br>

        <em>How is it different to IQ? </em>
        <br>
        Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of a persons numerical and analytical intelligence, referring to their ability to use logic and reason to problem solve.
        <br>
        Emotional Quotient (EQ) refers to a person's emotional intelligence, meaning their self-awareness, self regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. 
        <br>
        Unlike IQ, EQ is not derived from a set of standardised tests. 

        <br>
        <br>

        <em>Why is it important? </em>
        <br>
        Having good emotional intelligence benefits many aspects of life, as it dictates the relationships we have with ourselves and others.

      <p>
        <em>Neuroplasticity</em>
        <br>
        Being aware of the the principles of neuroplasticity improves both morale and performance. 
        By understanding that intelligence and ability aren't predetermined, we are able to use that knowledge to inform the way we engage with new information, content and practices. 
        Repetition is one way to increase neuroplasticity, practice helps you build stronger connections in the brain but retrieving memories and reviewing material and experience. Another useful tool is to put information into context. Introducing new information by relating it to existing knowledge allows you to build on existing pathways form stronger connections.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Growth Mindset</em>
        <br>
        Growth mindset is the counter to fixed mindset, it describes ones attitude towards their learning ability. In a fixed mindset you may believe that your abilities, intelligence and talents are set traits; resistant to change or improvement. In a growth mindset you understand that your abilities, intelligence and talents can be developed and learned with effort, persistence and good teaching. I think in conjunction with awareness of neuroplasticity, adopting a growth mindset is super empowering. It encourages me to be persistent, which is especially important when challenges seem too big or overwhelming.

        <em>Neuroplasticity, Growth Mindset and My Learning Plan</em>
        <br>
        These understandings of neuroplasticity and growth mindset as concepts shape and influence the way I will approach my learning plan and strategy. One of the challenges outlined in my learning plan is the difficulties I face with time-management. I think this is due to procrastination as a response to low self-confidence when in working abilities. With these two concepts in mind I will be able to face challenges more easily, knowing that failure is really a result of not trying.

      <p>
        <em>
          What are three new things you've learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </em>
        <ul>
          <li>My fear of being seen and vulnerable is an expression of my ego</li>
          <li>In order to learn to the best of my ability, I need to reach out and communicate my stuggles to others. </li>
          <li>That with patience, I will learn because I want to learn.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
       </em> 
       <br>
       Values, empathy, and self-awareness all play a huge role in our learning and programming journey. They're all contributing factors to a persons emotional intelligence, which is important when working constructively with others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning? 
        </em>
        <br>
        I didn't go into my core learning with many expectations of content. The thing that surprised me most was how difficult I found it in the first week to make a post in the discord channel introducing myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </em>
        <br>
        Being vulnerable, writing about ideas that are personal and that are maybe uncomfortable to share. Also being open to ideas that challenge the way you think about things and yourself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </em>
        <br>
        I don't know that it's the reason but the point is often made when talking about the core skills aspect to students, that having good human skills adds to your employability - that you'll be a more desireable candidate for a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
        </em>
        <br>
        No, I don't think it was a waste at all. I feel that a lot of the core material covered in foundations aids our programming learning. An obvious example of this is the Neuroplasicity and Growth Mindset module
        but it all works together (both core and tech) to make us well-rounded programmers.
