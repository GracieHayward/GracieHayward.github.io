      </p>

      <p>
        The CSS box model describes the properties that wrap around every HTML element.
        <br>
        Margins, borders, and padding are three properties that make up the CSS box model, as well as the content in the HTML element.
        <br>
        The padding, is the space surrounding the content.
        <br>
        The border is a visual representation of the edge of the padding 
        <br> 
        and the margin acts as a buffer, creating space around the HTML element.

      <p> 
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three foundational languages of the internet, working together to build a website. You could think of the languages like the physical make-up of a body. HTML are the bones of your website, a skeleton holding everything together. CSS would be the flesh, the appearance of your website and JavaScript is the muscles, allowing the body to be put in motion. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>What is control flow?</em>
        <br>
        Control flow is the order in which your computer executes statements within your JavaScript code. By default the code is executed from top to bottom, line by line. Although can change when the computer runs across any statement that affects the control flow such as loops, conditionals and functions. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>What is a loop?</em>
        <br>
        Loops are used in JavaScript to repeatedly run a block of code until a certain condition is met.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that represents all the data that makes up a webpage. The browser presents a document JavaScript object with a large number of properties and methods to allow us to interact directly with our HTML file. It's a 'tree' of objects, with JS objects representing the head, body, title, paragraphs, etc. It's similar to a family tree, except each object, method, or property has only one parent.
        <br>
        You might want to use the DOM to change elements or attributes of your document.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example if you wanted to change the text in your h1 element you could do so with this line of code:
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "your new header text"
      
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Accessing data from an array vs. an object</em>
        <br>
        Arrays and objects are both variables containing data. 
        <br>
        Arrays are a horizontal list, storing multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections because items can be accessed according to their numerical value within the index, which <b>starts at 0.</b>
        </b>
        <br>
        Objects are used to represent an item in your code, it could be a person, book, or anything that can defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. You can access this data by using dots or brackets. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What are functions?</em>
        <br>
        A function in JavaScript is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It will take an input and return an output once it's been defined and only after it's then called.

        <b>Problem Solving</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tell a story of a time you were blocked on a simple problem.</em>
        <br>
        A time when I was blocked on (an embarrassingly) simple problem, was barely related to code. It was when I recently misinterpreted an instruction and it sent me into a spiral of confusion. The problem I had was that the instructional ReadMe file said to run <em>```node filename```</em> in the commandline, which is exactly what I tried - including the backticks. But the backticks were only there to create a fenced code block in the github file and were not a part of the command. I couldn't understand why it wasn't working, because I didn't really understand what I was trying to do - only that I was being asked to do it. When I reached out to a fellow student who helped me by offering a different solution but I couldn't get past why it wasn't working. I eventually reached out to a facilitator who explained to me that the command didn't include the backticks and things became clear very quickly after that. 
        <br>
        The hardest thing for me when coming up against this problem was that it made me question my capability in general. It became larger than the problem itself. 
        <br>
        I learnt to be patient, that with persistance you can make it through obstacles. I was super disheartened when I had still felt confused after reaching out for help but sometimes it just takes talking to the right person at the right time, and the only way to get to that point is to push through. 
        
        <!--
         what was the problem?
         what problem-solving techniques did you use?
         how did you feel throughout the process?
         what did you learn?
        -->
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tell a story of a time you elegantly solved a problem.</em>
        <br>
        Without having a specific occasion to recall, I think the time's when I've solved a problem the most elegantly have often involved me taking a little break. Creating space in my mind by taking time away from the computer can be really helpful, allowing me to return to the problem with clear eyes. 
        <br>
        Another problem-solving technique that has worked super well for me is the rubber ducky method.  The idea behind the rubber ducky debugging technique is that when a programmer gets held back by bugs, the code is explained line by line to a rubber duck.
        When you encounter bugs and you explain the code line by line to a rubber duck, the solution to the bugs often presents itself right from there. I find it especially useful using this method when coding or working through something with another person. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Reflect on how confident you feel using problem-solving techniques/processes.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Pseudocode</li>
       <li>Trying something</li>
       <li>Reading error messages</li>
       <li>Console. logging</li>
       <li>Googling</li>
       <li>Asking peers for help</li>
       <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
       <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are all problem-solving techniques/processes that have been suggested or encouraged throughout the curriculum. All of which I've adopted at different points during foundations. I feel pretty confident using them all, with some working better for me than others. But I do employ most of them during each challenge - asking my peers or facilitators for help if all else fails.
