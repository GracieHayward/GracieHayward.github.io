      </p>

      <p>
        The CSS box model describes the properties that wrap around every HTML element.
        <br>
        Margins, borders, and padding are three properties that make up the CSS box model, as well as the content in the HTML element.
        <br>
        The padding, is the space surrounding the content.
        <br>
        The border is a visual representation of the edge of the padding 
        <br> 
        and the margin acts as a buffer, creating space around the HTML element.

      <p> 
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three foundational languages of the internet, working together to build a website. You could think of the languages like the physical make-up of a body. HTML are the bones of your website, a skeleton holding everything together. CSS would be the flesh, the appearance of your website and JavaScript is the muscles, allowing the body to be put in motion. 
      </p>

        <em>What is control flow?</em>
        <br>
        Control flow is the order in which your computer executes statements within your JavaScript code. By default the code is executed from top to bottom, line by line. Although can change when the computer runs across any statement that affects the control flow such as loops, conditionals and functions. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>What is a loop?</em>
        <br>
        Loops are used in JavaScript to repeatedly run a block of code until a certain condition is met.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that represents all the data that makes up a webpage. The browser presents a document JavaScript object with a large number of properties and methods to allow us to interact directly with our HTML file. It's a 'tree' of objects, with JS objects representing the head, body, title, paragraphs, etc. It's similar to a family tree, except each object, method, or property has only one parent.
        <br>
        You might want to use the DOM to change elements or attributes of your document.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example if you wanted to change the text in your h1 element you could do so with this line of code:
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "your new header text"
      
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Accessing data from an array vs. an object</em>
        <br>
        Arrays and objects are both variables containing data. 
        <br>
        Arrays are a horizontal list, storing multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections because items can be accessed according to their numerical value within the index, which <b>starts at 0.</b>
        </b>
        <br>
        Objects are used to represent an item in your code, it could be a person, book, or anything that can defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. You can access this data by using dots or brackets. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What are functions?</em>
        <br>
        A function in JavaScript is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It will take an input and return an output once it's been defined and only after it's then called.
