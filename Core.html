      Compassion, connection and integrity.
      <br> 
      During my studies (BFA in Fashion and Sustainability) I often considered my ethics and values, as the fashion industry is so rife with 
      exploitation of both people and resources. This forced me to confront my place and the implications 
      of my contributions to the sector. 
      <br>
      As part of my end of year collection, I chose to employ different sustainable practices to reflect my 
      personal values and to support ideas presented in my Fashion Theory paper. Mainly my focus was to make 
      my garments bio-degradable by constructing them with exclusively natural fibres, not using any notions 
      (metal buttons, zips etc.) and natural-dyeing, using plant extracts.
      I already had all of the fabrics and plant extracts needed for my collection when we went into a lockdown 
      but because of covid restrictions sourcing the silk thread that I'd intended on using became increasingly 
      difficult. Most threads available are a polyester/blend meaning they're non-biodegradable and while this 
      is a minor detail, I felt that using the polyester thread immediately available to me undermined the integrity
      of my work.
      <br>
      Because of time-restraints it was a decision between guaranteeing I finish my collection and get my degree, 
      or wait to source silk thread and risk breaching my deadline. I chose to continue with polyester 
      thread in order to finish my collection because ultimately that was more important to me but I was really 
      disappointed that I ended up producing something that contradicted the values that informed my planning and research.
